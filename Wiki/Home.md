# Welcome to the CLR Profiler CodePlex site
This site is designed for two very different audiences: Those who want to _use_ a profiler of managed code, and those who want to _write_ a profiler of managed code.

## I want to _use_ Microsoft's CLRProfiler
CLRProfiler is a free tool from Microsoft to help you diagnose memory issues with your managed app.  To download, go to the latest [release:Release Page](97738).

## I want to _write_ a profiler
See [Writing My Own Profiler](Writing-My-Own-Profiler)

## I have something to say or contribute
